# User Database Typescript

This project was my first time implementing Typescript. The app will allow you to view, sort, edit, delete and create user data. Structurally it is very similiar to [my recipe app](https://github.com/Anthony-Giusti/Recipes-Tracker). It uses React, Material UI, Node, Express and MongoDB. 

I worked on this primarily to get experience using Typescript on a real project. Prior to this I had gone through some learning materials but I wanted to use it in a more realistic setting. After creating this project with Typescript I definitely have more understanding of how useful it can be. I found myself coding in a more thoughful and clear way because of Typescript.
